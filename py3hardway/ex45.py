# This will run my game. I will create a file for characters, rooms, treasures.

# The game:
    # You start out on a hill tall enough to see everything at a distance
    # To the North is forest
        # Forest has 2 locations
            # Left Path, small pond with fairies
                #Touch water, get amulet, return to hill
            # Right path, bear den
    # To the West is a lake
        # The lake has 2 locations
            # bank, there is a small boat and a talking mask
            # small island, On the island is a puppet with latches on its head (for mask)\
                #Put mask on puppet, transport to hill, gain mask
    # To the East is a small desert
        # The desert has one location
            # In the distance as you start to head towards the desert you see
            # a giant pool of water
            # Location, you suddenly appear in an Oasis after passing out.
                # Oasis, a skeleton next to a sword
                    #skeleton talks
    # To the South is a little house and a farm
        # The Farm has a barn, a cottage, and a fenced area with sheep
            # barn, has one Hay bail in the middle (holds key)
            # cottage, smells like cooking (can't go inside without key)
                # Once inside, there is nothing but cobwebs and a fork on the table
                    #Grab Fork, and transport to hill
            # fenced area, sheep that just bah!
