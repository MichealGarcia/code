#Rules for for-loops and while-loops.
#Tips for debugging
#Another game


#Every if-statement must have an else
#if else wouldn't run, then youwill find errors

#never nest if-statements more than two deep, always try to stay one deep

#Treat if-statements like paragrapghs, put blank lines before and after

#Boolean tests should be simple


#While-loops
#Rarely use these (they are to loop forever)

#Use for-loop for everything else

#DEBUGGING

#Don't use a debugger
#Use print to print out the balues of variables at different points in the program

#Run code before moving to the next block


#You have already made a small game, so lets move on.
