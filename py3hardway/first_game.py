\t   This is a game that will always end the same.
\t       But there is only one way to beat it.


\t\t  Life is about the journey and I 
\t      hope you enjoy yours in this wonderful 
\t\t\t little adventure.

"And then the day came,
when the risk
to remain tight
in a bud
was more painful
than the risk
it took
to blossom."
