# # # ### Making a game

# # # # Open-world in a desert, there is a town nearby, an abandoned castle that 
# # # # is known to be haunted. The town-folk warn adventurers to stay clear of 
# # # # this mansion. The mansion was originally a center to a very old village
# # # # lost to time. 

# # # # In this world magic and supernatural is known generally, and explored
# # # # by adventurers, you are one of these adventurers, known as hunters
# # # # These hunters are mixed between several races (minotaurs, human, mythical beings)

# # # # hunters* are renwoned for hunting Djinn(evil spirits), and eliminating
# # # # them. When the hunter kills a Djinn it is possible to take on the powers
# # # # of the spirit. 
# # # #     There are 3 main types of enemy Djinns. 
# # # #         Blue, weakest huntable spirits
# # # #         red, mid-tier, need experience and strength
# # # #         purple, strongest, op as fuck, need smarts/abilities along power.
# # # #
# # # #
# # # #    BLUE: If you killed Djinn that had an ability better than yours, you could
# # #       take on ONE of those abilities or buffing attributes.
# #        RED: You can take on a physical attribute of these (If a minotaur, horns, or strength)
# #        PURPLE: These are unknown, as very little have been defeated.
