## Process to build things with OOP languages

# 1. Write or draw out the problem.
# 2. Extract key concepts from 1 and research them.
# 3. Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts.
# 4. Code the classes and a test to run them.
# 5. Repeat and refine.


# tips for step 2
    # Write down all the nouns and verbs created in step one. 
    # This will make a good list of functions and classes, to be refined.

# Once you have step 2 done yo can start outlining/make a tree 
# of the words and how they relate to eachother. Do they need a common
# mother class? etc.
# For the verbs you can find functions.

# Then write some skeleton code and a test to see if the classes and functions work together.

#The next part of this exercise will use this method.
